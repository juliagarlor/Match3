# Match3

Are you crazy about linning matching things? This game is simple but really addictive. Line at least 3 tiles of the same color and earn points and time. Shining tiles are special and you can get to get rid of entire rows and columns!

## How to play

This game has been developed in Lua, so you will need some special arrangements for using it. Don't worry though, you will have it working in no time with a very light program: Löve2D.

1. In order to get Löve2D installed and running, please visit the link: https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started and follow the instructions. Basically, download the most suitable Löve2D version for your device (it will just take a few seconds) and... that's all. If you double click on the Löve2D icon, a new window will be open with a little balloon of a duck with the legend "NO GAME". Everything good until now ╰(*°▽°*)╯.

2. Now, open the git bash in your device and travel to the most convenient location to place the project. In my case, I would like to place it in my desktop:

```
cd desktop
```

2. Execute the clone command of git, and the folder with the project will be created and completely loaded in your current location (desktop in my case). So in the git bash I would execute the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/juliagarlor/Match3.git
```

3. Now, the game engine is ready and the file containing our project has been downloaded. Everything is in place, so now take the project folder and drag it to the Löve2D icon. When you drop the folder in the icon, a new window should be open with the opening view of the game. 

4. Select start pressing enter, and move around the tile array using your keyboard arrows. If you want to select a tile, press enter when you are over it and then use the arrows to move it one tile up, down, left or right. When you have chosen the perfect position for this tile, press enter again, and the tile will swap with the chosen one. Choose wisely the tile to move though, because if you don't get a match in each movement, the tiles will swap back.

Have fun!
